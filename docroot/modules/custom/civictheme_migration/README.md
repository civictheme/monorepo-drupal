# CivicTheme Migration

Merlin Migration is imported via configuration form (`/admin/configuration/civictheme-migration`).

You can choose to manually upload the Merlin UI JSON files or retrieve the files from Merlin UI API endpoint.

After configuring a migration you can then begin the migration and setup your CivicTheme site.
