The types of cancers included breast cancer, liver cancer, bowel cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer.

In the control group, after 5 years 60% of patients had experienced a recurrence of their primary cancer or a secondary cancer. In the group who received the new treatment, only 20% had a recurrence of their primary cancer or a secondary cancer. This shows a significant difference between the two groups.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Importantly, mortality was also reviewed. In the control group 30% of patients had died by the 10-year followup, however only 10% of patients died in the experimental group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>'
