# Grid

Civic theme provides a customisable grid utilising a flex-based system.

## Grid System

Civic Component Library's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
Itâ€™s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. 

The system is adapted from the [SASS flexbox grid](http://sassflexboxgrid.com/).

### Example grid system markup

```html

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-l-6">100% extra-small viewport / 50% large viewport</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-m-4 col-l-3">50% extra-small viewport / 33% medium viewport / 25% large viewport</div>
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-m-4 col-l-3">50% extra-small viewport / 33% medium viewport / 25% large viewport</div>
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-m-4 col-l-3">50% extra-small viewport / 33% medium viewport / 25% large viewport</div>
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-m-4 col-l-3">50% extra-small viewport / 33% medium viewport / 25% large viewport</div>
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-m-4 col-l-3">50% extra-small viewport / 33% medium viewport / 25% large viewport</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xxs-12 ">100% at all viewports</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-l-6">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-l-12">Nested column is set within 50% width parent and so is 50% parent container width</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


```

## Containers and rows

Containers are used to contain and center content to a max-width per breakpoint. These are set via the `$civic-breakpoints` map.
If no container is set then columns spread full-width - this is utlised in Civic Page without sidebar where we have full-width
components and constraining of content is done on the component level.

Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling
the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content
in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.

## Columns

There are 12 columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span
any number of columns. 

Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., col-4 spans four).
Widths are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.

## Nested Grids

The grid system allows for nested grids. If a parent is 50% width (`col-xs-12`) and a container, row and column is placed inside of this
column then the max-width of the child column (with `col-xs-12` class) is 50% of the parent.

## Utilities

Civic component library come with a variety of [Grid utility mixins](../civic-library/components/00-base/mixins/_grid.scss)
including offset, row-reverse, flex-column among others.

## [Breakpoints](breakpoints.md)

## Advanced
For more advanced modification and overriding, the grid system internals are defined within `_variables.base.scss` 
which provides plenty of options to change the grid system
