The types of cancers included breast cancer, liver cancer, bowel cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer. All patients had surgical intervention prior to the chemotherapy treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Half the group followed standard chemotherapy protocols (control) and the other half received the new treatment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The results</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The patients were followed up at six-monthly intervals for 10 years. In the control group, after 5 years 60% of patients had experienced a recurrence of their primary cancer or a secondary cancer. In the group who received the new treatment, only 20% had a recurrence of their primary cancer or a secondary cancer. This shows a significant difference between the two groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Importantly, mortality was also reviewed. In the control group 30% of patients had died by the 10-year followup, however only 10% of patients died in the experimental group.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
