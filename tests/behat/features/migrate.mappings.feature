Feature: CivicTheme migrate module

  These tests assert migration update functionality, migration mappings and
  schema sources.

  # When _extending_ existing migrations, update fixture files and migration
  # result assertions below.
  #
  # When _adding_ new migrations, create new fixture files, add new tests
  # (copy from the existing tests below) and add migration result assertions.

  Background:
    Given no civictheme_page content:
      | title                     |
      | [TEST] Migrated Content 1 |
      | [TEST] Migrated Content 6 |

    And no managed files:
      | filename                                                 |
      | test_civictheme_migrate.node_civictheme_page_3.json      |
      | test_civictheme_migrate.media_civictheme_image_1.json    |
      | test_civictheme_migrate.media_civictheme_image_2.json    |
      | test_civictheme_migrate.media_civictheme_document_1.json |

    And managed file:
      | path                                                | filename                                                 | uri                                                               |
