  Scenario: CivicTheme page content type page can be viewed by anonymous with Webform
    Given I am an anonymous user
    And "field_c_n_components" in "civictheme_page" "node" with "title" of "[TEST] Page Webform test" has "civictheme_webform" paragraph:
      | field_c_p_webform          | Contact |
      | field_c_p_theme            | light   |

    When I visit "civictheme_page" "[TEST] Page Webform test"
    And I should see an "div.ct-webform" element
    And I should see an "div.ct-webform.ct-theme-light" element
    And I should see an "div.ct-webform.ct-vertical-spacing-inset--both" element
    And I should not see an "div.ct-webform.ct-theme-dark" element
